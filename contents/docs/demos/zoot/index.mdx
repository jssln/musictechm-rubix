Zoot is a modern electronic wind instrument that makes virtuoso-level playing accessible to everyone. The lightweight device captures breath nuances and offers intuitive touch-sensor fingering with motion gestures.

Zoot connects wirelessly to Apple devices through Bluetooth and includes a high-quality virtual clarinet sound. You can customize fingering systems, control pitch precisely, and even strum guitar chords for accompaniment.

Zoot is designed for responsiveness, expressiveness, and ease of use. Zoot weighs just 120g and runs for 10 hours on a single charge.

Daniel Ozick is a maker and engineer who has been tinkering with electronics and software since third grade, when he became obsessed with blinking small neon lamps. At iRobot, he led software development for the second-generation Roomba robotic vacuum and is named on multiple patents. Currently, as the founder of Computing Explorations, LLC, he helps startups bring new ideas to life, runs maker workshops, and continues to develop and market his own product: Zoot, a simple electronic wind instrument. You can often find him playing the Zoot as an “approximate clarinet” at informal music jams in the Boston area.
